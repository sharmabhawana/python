"""The tell() methods tells you the current position within the file;in other words the next read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.   
The seek(offset[,from]) method changes the current file position. The offset argument indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The from argument specifices the reference position where the bytes are to moved.
If from is set to 0, the reference position is the beginning of the file as the reference position and 1 means  the current  position  as the reference position; and if it is 2, the end of the file would be taken as the reference position. The default value for from is 0."""
